			<h2>How Do I Reach Space?</h2>	
			
			<p>I have always found intrest in the sky. Even as a child I would look up 
			and wonder what was out there? How can I get there? Well, space is not easily 
			reached so I found <strong>pictures</strong> and <strong>words</strong> to
			help me achieve space travel. I didn't think it was going to be achievable to
			save up for a <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/booking/">Trip To 
			Space</a>...or is it?</p>
		
			<p>This site is dedicated to helping me raise the funds to achieve my lifelong 
			dream of checking out what space is like. It has become a social experiment to 
			see if people I dont even know will <em>help out</em> and get me to outer
			space.</p>
