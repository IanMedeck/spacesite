	<h1>How Do I Reach Space?</h1>	
	<p>I have always found intrest in the sky. Even as a child I would look up 
	and wonder what was out there? How can I get there? Well, space is not easily 
	reached so I found pictures and words to help me achieve space travel. 
	I don't think it's going to be achievable to save up for a <a href="http://
	www.virgingalactic.com/booking/">Trip To Space</a>...or is it?</p>
	<p>This site is dedicated to helping me rase the funds to achieve my lifelong dream 
	of checking out what space is like.</p>
