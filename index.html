			<h2>How Do I Reach Space?</h2>	
			
			<p> "I have always found intrest in the sky. Even as a child I would look up 
			and wonder what was out there? How can I get there? Well, space is not easily 
			reached so I found <strong>pictures</strong> and <strong>words</strong> to
			help me achieve space travel. I didn't ever think it was going to be 
			achievable to get to outer space, but now I just need to save up for a
			<a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/booking/">trip to space</a>. Thanks to
			Virgin Galactics ambition I am one step closer, but that comes with a price.
			A very hefty one. I didn't let that get me down though! I just thought if I 
			could get 200k people to donate a dollar to <em>help out</em> I could float 
			that kind of bill.</p>
		
			<p>This site I created is dedicated to helping me raise the funds to achieve 
			my lifelong dream of checking out what space is like. It has become a social
			experiment to see if people I dont even know will <em>help out</em> and get 
			me a ride to outer space. I came up with the idea from living in Minneapolis
			and watching video's on Youtube. When I lived in Minneapolis people 
			would ask for spare change to ride the bus or whatever. It usually was outside
			Chicago Lake Liquor so it wasn't very hard to figure out what your spare 
			change was going towards. I figured I would take an honest approach if I'm 
			going to pan-handle my way to space. Also when I was watching viral video's 
			on Youtube that have had millions of viewers/hits that gave me the idea to 
			expand this idea to the web. Because I don't really have time to stand on the 
			corner somewhere and ask people for spare change working fulltime and going
			to school at <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu">Full Sail</a>.</p>
