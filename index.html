	<h1>How Do I Reach Space?</h1>	
	<p>I have always found intrest in the sky. Even as a child I would look up 
	and wonder what was out there? How can I get there? Well, space is not easily 
	reached so I found <strong>pictures</strong> and words to help me achieve
	space travel. I didn't think it was going to be achievable to save up for a 
	<a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/booking/">Trip To Space</a>...or is it?</p>
	<p>This site is dedicated to helping me raise the funds to achieve my lifelong dream 
	of checking out what space is like. It has become a social experiment to see if 
	people I dont even know will <em>help out</em> and get me to outer space.</p>
